### WHY ?

![vitest-view.png](imgs/vitest-view.png)

---

### Technologies

<!-- Include logos of React, TS, Ink, zustand -->

---

### Architecture

<!-- Do and include schema -->
---

### Exo abstraction
- todo: example of 2 duplicated tests

---

### Challenges
- No hot reload mode in Ink
- Bad errors display
- No easy way to debug other than writing to a file
- Test system
- Hard to be averted when on test update, had to reimplement watch mode
- exo abstraction

### Fun moments
- ASCII art
- So easy to deal with colors even with Gradient
- A lot of nice plugins
- A watch mode working very well - instant reload with native diff
